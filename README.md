Programming Approach :

We will design each logic function such as we are performing a left swipe then we will use it for right swipe by reversing matrix and performing left swipe.
Moving up can be done by taking transpose then moving left.
Moving down can be done by taking transpose the moving right.
All the logic in the program are explained in detail in the comments. Highly recommended to go through all the comments.
